# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on implementing state-of-the-art GitHub recommendations and best practices to transform the PointController Julia project into a professional, community-ready open source project. The goal is to establish industry-standard practices for repository management, community engagement, security, and maintainability that align with modern open source development workflows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Repository Structure and Organization

**User Story:** As an open source contributor, I want the repository to follow established conventions and best practices, so that I can easily understand the project structure and contribute effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the repository THEN the project SHALL have a clear, descriptive README with badges, installation instructions, and usage examples
2. WHEN examining the repository structure THEN it SHALL follow Julia package conventions with proper Project.toml, src/, test/, and docs/ organization
3. WHEN looking for contribution guidelines THEN the repository SHALL have CONTRIBUTING.md with clear instructions for development setup, testing, and submission process
4. WHEN checking project metadata THEN Project.toml SHALL include complete package information including repository URL, documentation URL, keywords, and proper version constraints
5. IF a user wants to understand changes THEN the repository SHALL have a CHANGELOG.md following Keep a Changelog format

### Requirement 2: Automated Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want comprehensive automated testing and quality checks, so that I can maintain code quality and catch issues before they reach users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to any branch THEN GitHub Actions SHALL automatically run the full test suite on multiple Julia versions (1.10, 1.11, nightly)
2. WHEN code is pushed THEN CI SHALL test on multiple operating systems (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows) to ensure cross-platform compatibility
3. WHEN tests complete THEN code coverage SHALL be automatically calculated and reported via Codecov integration
4. WHEN code is submitted THEN automated formatting checks SHALL verify code follows JuliaFormatter.jl standards
5. IF tests fail or coverage drops significantly THEN the CI SHALL block merging and notify maintainers
6. WHEN documentation changes are made THEN automated builds SHALL verify documentation compiles successfully

### Requirement 3: Security and Dependency Management

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want automated security monitoring and dependency management, so that the project remains secure and up-to-date without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the repository is configured THEN Dependabot SHALL be enabled for automatic dependency updates and security alerts
2. WHEN security vulnerabilities are detected THEN GitHub SHALL automatically create security advisories and suggest fixes
3. WHEN dependencies have updates THEN Dependabot SHALL create pull requests with appropriate labels and testing
4. WHEN secrets or sensitive data are committed THEN secret scanning SHALL detect and alert maintainers immediately
5. IF code scanning detects potential security issues THEN CodeQL SHALL create alerts with remediation suggestions

### Requirement 4: Community Engagement Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a potential contributor, I want clear pathways for engagement and contribution, so that I can effectively participate in the project community.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user wants to report a bug THEN they SHALL have access to structured issue templates that gather necessary information
2. WHEN a user wants to request a feature THEN they SHALL have access to feature request templates with clear requirements gathering
3. WHEN a contributor submits a pull request THEN they SHALL have access to PR templates with checklists for code quality and testing
4. WHEN users have questions THEN GitHub Discussions SHALL be enabled with appropriate categories (General, Q&A, Ideas, Show and Tell)
5. IF users want to contribute THEN the repository SHALL have clear labels for "good first issue" and "help wanted" to guide new contributors

### Requirement 5: Documentation and Knowledge Management

**User Story:** As a user or contributor, I want comprehensive, automatically updated documentation, so that I can understand how to use and contribute to the project effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation is updated THEN Documenter.jl SHALL automatically build and deploy to GitHub Pages
2. WHEN the API changes THEN documentation SHALL automatically reflect the changes through docstring integration
3. WHEN users visit the documentation site THEN they SHALL find getting started guides, API reference, examples, and troubleshooting information
4. WHEN contributors need guidance THEN CONTRIBUTING.md SHALL provide clear development setup, testing procedures, and code style guidelines
5. IF users encounter issues THEN troubleshooting documentation SHALL provide solutions for common problems

### Requirement 6: Release Management and Versioning

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want automated release management and proper versioning, so that users can reliably track changes and updates to the project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new version is tagged THEN TagBot SHALL automatically create GitHub releases with changelog information
2. WHEN releases are created THEN they SHALL follow semantic versioning (SemVer) principles with clear version numbering
3. WHEN changes are made THEN CHANGELOG.md SHALL be updated following Keep a Changelog format with categorized changes
4. WHEN preparing for Julia registry registration THEN the package SHALL meet all General registry requirements
5. IF breaking changes are introduced THEN they SHALL be clearly documented with migration guides

### Requirement 7: Branch Protection and Code Review

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want enforced code review processes and branch protection, so that code quality is maintained and changes are properly reviewed before merging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is submitted to main branch THEN it SHALL require pull request review before merging
2. WHEN pull requests are created THEN all CI checks SHALL pass before merging is allowed
3. WHEN reviews are requested THEN CODEOWNERS file SHALL automatically assign appropriate reviewers
4. WHEN conversations exist on PRs THEN all conversations SHALL be resolved before merging
5. IF administrators make changes THEN they SHALL also be subject to the same review requirements

### Requirement 8: Performance and Quality Monitoring

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want continuous monitoring of code quality and performance, so that regressions are caught early and code quality trends are visible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code coverage is calculated THEN it SHALL be tracked over time with targets for minimum coverage (>80%)
2. WHEN performance-critical code changes THEN benchmarks SHALL be run to detect performance regressions
3. WHEN code quality metrics are available THEN they SHALL be displayed via badges in the README
4. WHEN dependencies are updated THEN compatibility testing SHALL verify no breaking changes are introduced
5. IF quality metrics decline THEN maintainers SHALL be notified through appropriate channels

### Requirement 9: Accessibility and Inclusivity

**User Story:** As a diverse contributor, I want the project to be welcoming and accessible, so that I can participate regardless of my background or technical setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN contributing guidelines are provided THEN they SHALL include a code of conduct promoting inclusive behavior
2. WHEN documentation is created THEN it SHALL be accessible to users with different technical backgrounds
