# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a Julia application that displays an interactive point visualization using GLMakie. The user can control the point's position in real-time using WASD keyboard inputs, where the point moves continuously while keys are held down and stops when keys are released.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a visual point on screen, so that I can interact with it through keyboard controls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL display a window with a visible point at the center coordinates (0, 0)
2. WHEN the window is displayed THEN the system SHALL show coordinate axes for reference
3. WHEN the application is running THEN the system SHALL maintain a responsive graphical interface

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to move the point using WASD keys, so that I can control its position interactively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the 'W' key is pressed and held THEN the system SHALL continuously move the point upward (positive Y direction)
2. WHEN the 'S' key is pressed and held THEN the system SHALL continuously move the point downward (negative Y direction)
3. WHEN the 'A' key is pressed and held THEN the system SHALL continuously move the point leftward (negative X direction)
4. WHEN the 'D' key is pressed and held THEN the system SHALL continuously move the point rightward (positive X direction)
5. WHEN multiple keys are pressed simultaneously THEN the system SHALL move the point diagonally in the combined direction
6. WHEN no keys are pressed THEN the system SHALL keep the point stationary at its current position

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want real-time coordinate updates, so that I can see the exact position of the point as it moves.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the point moves THEN the system SHALL update the displayed coordinates in real-time
2. WHEN the point is stationary THEN the system SHALL display the current static coordinates
3. WHEN coordinates change THEN the system SHALL refresh the display smoothly without flickering

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a properly configured Julia workspace, so that I can develop and run the application efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the project THEN the system SHALL create a proper Julia project structure with Project.toml
2. WHEN dependencies are needed THEN the system SHALL include GLMakie in the project dependencies
3. WHEN the project is activated THEN the system SHALL allow running the application without manual package installation
4. WHEN the code is organized THEN the system SHALL follow Julia best practices for project structure
