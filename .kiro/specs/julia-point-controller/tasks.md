  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 2. Implement core data structures and state management
  - Create MovementState struct to track key presses and movement speed
  - Implement key mapping dictionary for WASD controls
  - Create observable point position using GLMakie's Observable type
  - Write unit tests for data structure initialization and basic operations
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6_

- [x] 3. Create basic GLMakie visualization setup
  - Initialize GLMakie backend with appropriate configuration
  - Create figure and axis with coordinate system
  - Implement basic point rendering using scatter plot
  - Add coordinate text display that updates with point position
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 3.1, 3.2_

- [x] 4. Implement keyboard event handling system
  - Set up GLMakie keyboard event listeners for key press and release
  - Create functions to handle individual key press and release events
  - Implement key state tracking to maintain which keys are currently pressed
  - Write unit tests for key event processing logic
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5_

- [x] 5. Develop movement calculation and update logic
  - Implement function to calculate movement vector from currently pressed keys
  - Create position update logic that applies movement vector to current coordinates
  - Handle diagonal movement when multiple keys are pressed simultaneously
  - Write unit tests for movement calculations and position updates
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6_

- [x] 6. Integrate continuous movement with timing system
  - Set up timer-based update loop for smooth continuous movement
  - Connect keyboard state to movement updates with proper timing
  - Ensure point stops immediately when keys are released
  - Implement smooth coordinate display updates during movement
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 7. Create main application entry point and event loop
  - Implement main function that initializes all components
  - Set up GLMakie window with proper configuration
  - Connect all event handlers and start the application loop
  - Ensure proper cleanup and window management
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 4.3_

- [x] 8. Add comprehensive testing and validation
  - Write integration tests for complete keyboard-to-movement flow
  - Test simultaneous key press combinations for diagonal movement
  - Validate coordinate display accuracy during movement
  - Create manual testing procedures for interactive validation
  - _Requirements: 2.5, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 9. Implement error handling and robustness features
  - Add GLMakie initialization error handling with clear messages
  - Implement graceful handling of invalid key inputs
  - Add performance optimizations for smooth rendering
