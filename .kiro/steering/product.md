# Product Overview

PointController is an interactive Julia application that provides real-time point control using WASD keyboard inputs with GLMakie visualization. The application demonstrates modern Julia GUI development patterns with performance optimization and robust error handling.

## Core Features

- **Interactive Point Control**: Real-time point movement using WASD keys with smooth continuous motion
- **Visual Feedback**: Live coordinate display and reference grid system for precise positioning  
- **Diagonal Movement**: Natural diagonal movement when multiple keys are pressed simultaneously
- **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive error recovery for graphics, input, and system issues
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient rendering and input processing with 60 FPS smooth animation

## Target Users

- Julia developers learning GUI development with Makie.jl
- Educational demonstrations of interactive graphics programming
- Developers needing a reference implementation for keyboard-controlled applications
- Users requiring a simple, responsive point control interface

## Key Value Propositions

- **Modern Architecture**: Follows current Julia and Makie.jl best practices
- **Educational Value**: Well-documented codebase suitable for learning
- **Extensibility**: Modular design allows easy feature additions
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows with proper graphics support

## Application Behavior

- **Movement Controls**: W (up), A (left), S (down), D (right) keys for point movement
- **Quit Function**: Q key to exit application gracefully
- **Coordinate Range**: Point moves within -10 to +10 coordinate space
- **Visual Elements**: Red point marker, coordinate text display, reference grid
- **Window Management**: Resizable window with proper focus handling

## Technical Highlights

- **Backend Activation Pattern**: Users control GLMakie backend activation (modern Makie.jl pattern)
- **Observable System**: Reactive UI updates using GLMakie's Observable pattern
- **Timer-Based Movement**: Smooth continuous movement with frame-rate independence
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of graphics, input, and system errors
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite with 357+ passing tests
